# Jobflirt - The Job Matching App

**Jobflirt** is a job-matching app designed to make the job search as simple and intuitive as a dating app. Instead of searching for dates, you're searching for job opportunities! Highlight your skills and preferences, browse through potential employers, and swipe to apply for jobs that catch your eye. Companies can also swipe through candidate profiles, making the recruitment process faster and more engaging.

## Features

- **Swipe to Apply**: Job seekers can swipe right to apply for a job or swipe left to pass.
- **Personalized Profile**: Create a profile that showcases your skills, experience, and job preferences to attract employers.
- **Company Profiles**: Discover detailed company profiles and swipe right to express interest in their job postings.
- **Instant Match**: When both a candidate and a company show mutual interest, it's a match! This instantly notifies both parties.
- **Seamless Applications**: Forget long forms—when you match, your profile is sent directly to the company.
- **Tailored Job Recommendations**: Get job suggestions tailored to your skills, location, and preferences.

## How It Works

### For Job Seekers:

1. Create a profile by filling in your work experience, skills, and preferred job type.
